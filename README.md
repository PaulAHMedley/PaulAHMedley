- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PaulAHMedley
- I am interested in fish stock assessment and modelling fisheries data, particularly for data-limited fisheries. I have been working recently on models for better interpretation of length frequency data.  
- I am using Github primarily as a way to convenient distribute R functions. 
- ðŸ“« I can be contacted through email: paulahmedley@gmail.com
