- Hello, I’m @PaulAHMedley
- I am interested in fish stock assessment and modelling fisheries data, particularly for data-limited fisheries. I have been working recently on models for better interpretation of length frequency data (BLICC).  
- I am using Github primarily as a convenient way to distribute R functions in a package. 
- I can be contacted through email: paulahmedley@gmail.com
